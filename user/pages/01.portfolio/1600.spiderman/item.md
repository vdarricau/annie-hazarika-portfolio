As Miles Morales says in Into The Spider-Verse, anyone can wear the mask.
Ahead of the much-awaited release of Spider-Man: No Way Home, which brings together all previous iterations of the Wall-crawling Web-head through the multiverse, we bring to you the North-East Indian iteration of the Friendly Neighbourhood Superhero. Because anyone can be a hero. 

The decision to create the NorthEastern version of Spider-Man came from the obvious lack of representation of the region in any mainstream media, as well as the intention of showcasing the iconic cultural aspects of NE Tribes that parallel the Western Superhero world.
