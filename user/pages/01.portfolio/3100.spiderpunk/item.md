What if, Spiderpunk was performing sets in the northeast of india? 🎸

Where rock, grunge, and metal found Indian homes long before the nation’s metropolises were ready for them. Meghalaya being the rock capital of india.
We as people from the north-east can travel an hour or two in any direction and suddenly find that their mother tongue is not understood any more. The experience can be disorienting but perhaps also liberating. It allows us to shed our linguistic identity and become true polyglots.

So here's to allll the incredible musicians we have back home, and to Hobie brown. Please do a set in the northeast of india. We want you! ✨🕷️
