Ghor Jeuti: The word translates to "light of the house".

Ghor Jeuti is a benign female spirit presiding over a man's house, she is usually heard making ticking sounds in the house.

"The whole idea of this artwork came to me after I had one interesting conversation with my Aaita (grandmother). Surprisingly, she didn't mention the word "ahost" even once and went on explaining to me what ghor jeuti means.

From all the information I gathered, I learnt that "ghor jeuti" means the light of the house and it is said that the "buari" (Woman of the house/ daughter in law) of the house is the one who brings the light into the house. It is also said that a ghor jeuti would only be present in a household which has a good
"buari". I instantly flashed back to a conversation with my very dear friend and how we talked about how educated women can bring the brightest change in our future and grow up to be better leaders. And thus, I feel extremely blessed to have chosen this particular topic and I went on to illustrate a beautiful relationship between a ghor jeuti and the
"buari". 

An educated "buari" would indeed be able to bring the light into the house, into the world, and into a better future.
